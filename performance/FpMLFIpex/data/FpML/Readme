FpML 4.0 Recommendation - Readme file
=====================================

The "xml" directory contains the following:

fpml-XXX-4-0.xsd : schema files, as follows:

cross-product schema files:
fpml-main-4-0.xsd : main include driver
fpml-doc-4-0.xsd : document and trade level definitions (previously in main)
fpml-shared-4-0.xsd : reusable shared types 
fpml-enum-4-0.xsd : reusable enumerations
fpml-msg-4-0.xsd : messaging definitions
fpml-asset-4-0.xsd : simple assets, used as underlyers (previously in eqs)

product-specific schema files:
fpml-cd-4-0.xsd : credit derivatives
eqd - equity derivative options
eqs - equity derivative swaps
fx - foreign exchange
ird - interest rate derivatives

Plus, the xml directory contains subdirectories for each subset of the 
FpML standard, namely:

cd - credit derivatives
eqd - equity derivative options
eqs - equity derivative swaps
fx - foreign exchange
ird - interest rate derivatives
msg - messaging

Each subdirectory contains a number of example files.  These files are named as follows:
YY40_exNN_long_description.xml, 
where
YY is the subset identifier and
NN is an integer number.

The examples have a schemaLocation attribute that references their parent 
directory.  In other words, the FpML schema much be present in the parent 
directory of the example file for the example file to validate using the 
schemaLocation attribute.

The schemaLocation attribute previously referenced the examples own directory, 
and extra copies of the schema files were placed in each example directory.
This simplified validation of the examples and helped certain tools to work
properly, but caused some users confusion.

The examples have been validated using Xerces J v 2.4.1 and MSXML v 4.0.
